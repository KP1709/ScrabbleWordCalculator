## üçº Introduction
Owning and playing the original version of Scrabble, I know it would sometimes be difficult to calculate a word's score. Therefore, I created my own version of a Scrabble calculator. The user enters a word and is able to see the word's score. Additionally the tool checks to see if the word is in the dictionary using a free dictionary API. Therefore enabling the user to test to see if a particular word exists. The app is also connected to a database to search for words which are valid in Scrabble but are not in the dictionary API.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Check to see if user input is valid
  - Checks to see if word contains alphabetic characters only
  - Checks to see if word is in the dictionary (using free API)
  - Checks to see if word is in the Supabase database (if not in the API) 
- Score for whole word is calculated
- Tried to maintain accessibility throughout application
- Instructions available on the start screen as an open and closable modal
- Can indicate which tiles have a double score or triple score and update the total word score 
- Can indicate if the total word score doubles or triples
  -  Option to reset score without multiplier

## ‚ö°Supabase
A Supabase database is connected by creating a Netlify serverless function. The word entered to search will pass by POST request to the Supabase client which will complete a GET request to check if the word exists in the database. The code has been set up so the database will only be searched if the word doesn't exist in the free dictionary API. The serverless function also contains error handling to provide a solid user experience. It's very unlikely for the database to be searched often.

In the future I may create another web application (or in this app ü§î) which enables words to be added through a user interface + having users request for words which are missing in the tool but are valid to use.

### üß™ Experiment
The requests can be seen in action from the network response tab and developer console in the browser dev tools.  
Search for the word 'zarf' or 'bezique' - the first API will return a 404 but the word exists in the Supabase database so it will return a 200.

## ü§ñ AI Assistance
To implement the double/triple tile score and the double/triple total word score feature, I asked V0 by Vercel to create code which implemented the logic I was after. The code was specified to be written in React but the AI chose to use Typescript. I integrated the code into the original code I wrote. 

### Prompts asked in order:
- "Create a button in react which toggles between doubling and halving the number"
- "Do this but enable the button to cycle through the original value, doubling and tripling"
- "Do this for multiple buttons"
- "Do this but add together the total value from the buttons"
- "Do this but includes buttons which can multiply the total by 2 and by 3"

(Outcome and results will vary)
