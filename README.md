## ‚å®Ô∏è Tech stack
React / Typescript / CSS / npm / Nodejs / HTML / APIs

## üçº Introduction
Owning and playing the original version of Scrabble, I know it would sometimes be difficult to calculate a word's score. Therefore, I created my own version of a Scrabble calculator. The user enters a word and is able to see the word's score. Additionally the tool checks to see if the word is in the dictionary using a free dictionary API. Therefore enabling the user to test to see if a particular word exists.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Check to see if user input is valid
  - Checks to see if word contains alphabetic characters only
  - Checks to see if word is in the dictionary (using free API)
- Score for whole word is calculated
- Tried to maintain accessibility throughout application
